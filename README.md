# Jade

JAM service libraries.

- Libraries started with `jam-` including `crates/cli` are basically forks of the work done by
  the `polkajam` team from crates.io.
- Libraries started with `jade-` are for the `jade` project.
- Libraries started with `spacejam` will be migrated to the `spacejam` main repo once
  we got open sourced.
